        <h1>The perfect trip</h1>
Should I ever get so rich to travel, I'll spend more time exploring Nigeria first. Ever heard of <strong>Yankari Games Reserve</strong> in Nigeria?<br>
If you watched the <em>"Up North"</em> Movie, You'll understand what I am talking about. Frankly, the movie piqued my interest in visiting the place.

        <p>I look forward to seeing scenes like <ul>
          <li>The rocks and water: You know how much bliss that comes from such beautiful view? I'll let you know when I visit</li><br>

<br>
<br>
          <li>The animals: If you are a fan of movies like me, you'll probably marvel at the sight of animals you don't see frequently.</li>

        </ul></p>

        <p>And the food!</p>

        <p>What's a perfect trip without <em>good</em> food? I am always open to trying out new foods wherever I go. <br>
          However, Amala still tops my list. In cases where amala may not be available, I could settle and eat food like suya, gurasa, rice or masa </p>
