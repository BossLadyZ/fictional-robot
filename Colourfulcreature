        <p>The <em>horse</em> is awesome because of its <strong>strenth</strong>.The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. <br>
          It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. <br>
          The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, <br>
          single-toed animal of today. <br>
          Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC.</p>
