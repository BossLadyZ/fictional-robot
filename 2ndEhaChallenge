        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at <em>0</em>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn.</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <br>
        Until <em>one day,</em> you walk.<br>
        <br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
      <strong>Failing is just another word for growing.</strong>  <br>
      <br>
      <em>And you keep going.</em> <br>
        <br>

      <em>This.</em>   is. learning.<br>
        It’s <em>not</em> that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet</em>.<br>
        <br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere can understand</em>.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know <em>one thing</em>:<br>
      <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
